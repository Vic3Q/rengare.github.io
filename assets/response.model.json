Several Oracle backups were affected by failures or retry attempts or had to be suspended, because resources were unavailable temporarily. A notification on limited service availability was sent out.\r\n\r\nConnectivity issues have been solved now, therefore I am closing this ticket. Feel free to reopen it, if you think backup jobs are still running too slow.\r\n\r\nApart from that, we increased the number of RMAN channels from 4 to 6 as by the Oracle team's request and according to a database size of 23 TB.\r\n\r\nRegards, Hubert\n\n16 May 2018 17:40:19 - Katarzyna Formejster (Customer communication)\nDear Team, \r\n\r\nCould you please verify if additional streams help to speed it up?\r\ni see job is running 2 days - 14\/05\/2018.\r\n\r\nregards, Kasia\n\n08 May 2018 13:47:38 - Jakub Kluba (Customer communication)\nDear Team\r\n\r\nYour ticket has been acknowledged and will be investigated. \r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nJakub, Enterprise Backup\n\n08 May 2018 13:01:01 - Joerg Bieri (Customer communication)\nIt is obvious that the backup is still running!
